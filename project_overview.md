# Introduction

The title of the project is "Data Analysis: Scientific image processing by
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)"

The advertised project description is "We collect a lot of data and it is
essential to analyse them in an efficient and optimised manner. In this project
you will use the CUDA programming model by Nvidia for accelerated image
analysis. You will perform operations such as noise reduction, feature
detection and down sampling in GPU with real experimental data collected at our
beamlines."

The duration of the project is two and a half day of actually working on the
project, and a half day for the students to prepare for a presentation (or do a
little bit of work on the actual project) which they will present to their
fellow students and invited guests (mostly family members).

# Brief Outline

- Familiar with the GPU architecture and CUDA programming model (resources will
be prepared)
- Familiar with the usage of HPC system (examples will be given)
- Understand the concept of kernel (by exploring in CPU)
- Perform kernel operation on dummy data by CPU
- Perform kernel operation on dummy data by GPU in HPC
- Run GPU kernel operation on experimental data (from i14/i13-1)
- Explore the effect of the applied kernel operation on experimental data
- Feature detection on diffraction data (if time allows)
