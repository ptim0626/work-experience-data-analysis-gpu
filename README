The repository hosts the information and scripts for the work experience
project "Data analysis: Scientific image processing by Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU)" at Diamond Light Source.

These materials were developed in 2025 when I was preparing this work experience
project for the first time. This serves as a reference for people who want to
organise it in the future (which I strongly encourage you to do so!).
