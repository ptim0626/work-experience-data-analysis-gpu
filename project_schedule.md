Room: G53

Time: 09:30 - 17:00, with breaks at least once an hour.

## Morning (09:00 - 12:00)

### (09:00 - 09:30) Arrival and settling

### (09:30 - 10:00) Welcome and introductions

#### Activity

- Self-introduction (e.g. What do I do in Diamond? How I end up here?)
- Students introduce themselves (background etc.) and their interests briefly.
- Brief overview of the work experience project.

#### Materials

- Note about project goals and what we will achieve (welcome.pdf)
- A schedule overview (schedule.pdf)
- Few simple questions to prompt students' introduction (intro\_prompts.pdf)

### (10:00 - 11:00) Introduction to GPU Architecture & CUDA Programming Model

#### Activity

- Go through the prepared interactive tutorial/materials on GPU concepts (SPMD/SIMD, Host vs. Device, SMs, threads, warps).
- Understanding facilitated by discussion, answering questions and analogies.
- Watch 1-2 short supplementary videos.

#### Materials

- Interactive Jupyter notebook tutorial covering GPU concepts with visualisations (gpu\_concept.ipynb)

- Links of some educational videos (video\_link.txt)

### (11:00 - 12:00) Introduction to High-Performance Computing (HPC) System

#### Activity

Students use the prepared guide to log into the HPC system.

- Practice basic terminal commands: ssh, cd, ls, pwd.
- Learn to use nano to create a dummy text file.
- Explain the concept of a queuing system (Slurm).

#### Materials

- Terminal basic navigation reference (terminal\_cmd\_reference.pdf)
